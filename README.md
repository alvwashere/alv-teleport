# Alv-Teleports

> Tired of your generic teleporting script that runs insanely high due to loops and low wait timers?

**Look no further!**

This resource was designed in [OX Lib](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib) and [ESX Framework](https://github.com/esx-framework) (which is optional, only use is for Floating Text). It simply will replace your old teleport script where you enter a marker or point on the map, and it will teleport you to a different place. This script is great for accessing GTA:O interiors that are not openly available on the map without teleportation.

> The Config has three locations preset, they are GTA:O Drug Interiors, but the possibilites are endless, you could use this script for the Offices, Facilities, Penthouses and a lot more. You could even just use the script for generally teleporting around the map.

The script is open source, so if you wanted to make the script more advanced, you could definitely do that. However, I will only provide support if the script is not working and you have met the requirements. My links are provided below for script previews, downloads and support/contacting me.
